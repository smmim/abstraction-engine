abstraction or elaboration = transmutation

-able to take info and abstract the info or elaborate on it
  -take info from one level of abstraction to another
  -elaboration: [a human] --> [a collection of [organ]s]
  -abstraction: an [organ] + several other [organ]s --> a human
  
essentially a framework for a series of scripts to do the actual abstraction
  -someone creates a script to transmute data of abs. level 1 to level 2
    -e.g. a civ5 savegame --> parse out a city --> use attributes from city to guess at more data
      -e.g. guess at crime rate, income, etc. from happiness level
